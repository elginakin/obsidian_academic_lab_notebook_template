> [!NOTE] Welcome 👋 This lab notebook is structured in Obsidian. 
> There are 7 introductory notes intended to help orient you to the basic structure I have implemented. Given the incredible flexibility of Obsidian, almost every detail of the structure is customizable to your needs and use-case. Each of the introduction files are written in order and unfortunately are not exhaustive to the potential richness each feature has to offer. In this introduction I review: 
> - [[1️⃣ The philosophy behind this lab notebook -  🚧 under construction]]
> - [[2️⃣  Intro - Project & Experiment ID -  🚧 under construction]]
> - [[3️⃣   Intro - How this Vault is Structured -  🚧 under construction]]
> - [[4️⃣  Intro - Your first experiment -  🚧 under construction]] 
> - [[5️⃣ Intro - Your first protocol -  🚧 under construction]]
> - [[6️⃣ Task and Experiment Management - 🚧 under construction]]
> - [[7️⃣  ADDITIONAL SECTIONS to work on]]

# To begin, I'll share a few themes which underly this notebook: 

1. Automated directory-based organization of experiments and protocols
2. Automated organization of meetings, seminar coursework and literature notes. 
3. Automated directory-based structuring in a text-file dependent manner.
4. "A 'file over app' philosophy - [File over app — Steph Ango](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)
5. Local file-based ownership - Everything is stored on your machine **first**.
6. Utilization of the power of bac-klinking, a core feature of Obsidian.

# What is Obsidian?
Many Obsidian users have summarized the power of this application. I'll leave a couple of my optional introduction resources below: 
- [Getting Started with Obsidian Notes: A Beginner’s Guide - Obsidian Rocks](https://obsidian.rocks/getting-started-with-obsidian-a-beginners-guide/)
- [The Complete Beginner's Guide to Using Obsidian](https://bobbypowers.com/beginners-guide-to-obsidian/)

Furthermore, Obsidian has an excellent and ever-growing community. I would highly recommend visiting the discussion forums, joining the discord, and scraping the internet for additional resources and use-cases for this program.

# The Notebook's Caveats: 

- There are so many caveats to any data and thought management system...almost too many to mention but I'll try to summarize.
	1. The PhD journey is a combination of self and your environment. If your lab has a particular way of planning, executing, and recording findings, this notebook may not be for you.
	2. Security: Some PhD work involves sensitive clinical information and requires more sensitive approaches including commercial ELNs. While obsidian is simply a simplistic "front end" for markdown files, many users may hesitate to use it.
	3. Overcomplicating a 'simple process'. Some may feel this way 🤷.
