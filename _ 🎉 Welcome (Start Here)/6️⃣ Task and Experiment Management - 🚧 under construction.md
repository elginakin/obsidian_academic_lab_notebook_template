# The [[weekly]] template and the "Templater" plugin

If you dive right in to the [[weekly]] template note in the `_templates` folder, you'll notice that it looks very different than the other templates. This is because this note takes advantage of the Templater plugin which uses [specific syntax](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/terminology.html) which needs to be processed by 'executing' the plugin in order to convert functions into a final note in plain text. 

# Using the Calendar plugin for 
- [[weekly]] notes 
- [[daily]] notes

# Using the calendar plugin to create all [[weekly]] and [[daily]] notes

1. click on a week number to initiate the [[weekly]] template.

2. This will automatically execute Templater and convert the syntax into dates relative to the week selected in the calendar (pretty nifty right?) - click the image below to increase the size.

FYI: Once you open a file, the Templater plugin will automatically trigger and convert all syntax into plain text based on the instructions provided.
