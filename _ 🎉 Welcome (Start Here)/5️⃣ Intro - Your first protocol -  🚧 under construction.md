# Creating a protocol using the [[protocol template]] template


> [!NOTE] Example Protocol is included
> An [[protocol - freezing cells (example protocol)|example protocol]] has been included in this vault.


1. To create a new experiment use the keyboard shortcut `cmd + n` to open a new note 

2. Give your protocol a name. We need to include the work `protocol` in the note title in order for the note to be moved later since we do not want experiment or other notes that contain the tag #protocol to be moved into this folder. With this structure, we can later filter experiments which utilize pre-existing protocol templates which may differ from experiments which are either made to generate new protocols or do not use one of your pre-established protocol in any way.`


> [!WARNING] Different Auto Note Mover Syntax Here
> - Using regex, the auto note mover plugin is set to find any note with the string 'protocol' and move it to the `_templates` folder automatically. 
> - ‼️This also means that any note with the work protocol in its title will be moved to the `_templates` folder in this current structure.


3. Next, apply the experiment template by using `cmd + t` and navigating to the `protocol` template using either your mouse of the arrow keys followed by 'enter'. 

4. The anatomy of the protocol template is quite simple: 
	1. The note title: again, the work protocol - must be somewhere in the note for it to be automatically moved
	2. tags: It is wise to add the original date of the protocol here - the back-linking of the date may be irrelevant unless the protocol is relatively new. 
	3. author: the author of the protocol
	4. The Protocol Body: 
		1. Protocol Name: In cases I do deviate from the protocol slightly in an experiment, I like to have a backlink to the original protocol within the protocol itself. It takes an extra second or two to type in after you've made the protocol, but if you add a protocol within an experiment, it will save you some time and add a connection between the experiment and protocol. 
		2. Protocol Description: Use the power of the digital lab notebook here. Adding a descriptive protocol description saves future users a lot of headache and may save you time answering basic questions in the future. 
		3. Materials and Reagents: Self explanatory. 
		4. The Procedure: Structure your protocol as you wish! 
		5. the changelog and references section: I do not use this very often but if I have performed a change in the protocol that I wish to make permanent, I'll add it to the template and make a note as to when and what was changed. It is a good practice in general.
