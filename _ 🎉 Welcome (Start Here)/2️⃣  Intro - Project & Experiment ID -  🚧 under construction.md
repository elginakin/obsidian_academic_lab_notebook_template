The structure of this lab notebook depends on a simple organizational hierarchy of: 
- Project Identifiers
- Experiment Identifiers
- Experiment sub-Identifiers: For repeat experiments. 

This philosophy can be daunting at first especially if migrating from an entirely different way of recording and recalling experimental procedures and results. The underlying structure of this vault relies on the **experiment identifier** for organization. The structure of this identifier is simple and contains a Project ID, Experiment ID, and optional sub ID.
