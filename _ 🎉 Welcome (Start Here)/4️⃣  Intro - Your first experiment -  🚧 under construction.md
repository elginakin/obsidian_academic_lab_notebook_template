# Creating an experiment using the [[experiment]] template 

1. To create a new experiment use the keyboard shortcut `cmd + n` to open a new note 
   
2. Give your Experiment an identifier and name. Since we already have an example experiment called [[P1E01 - Some Experiment Name]], let's create a second experiment. Name this experiment `P1E02` - and give it a name (e.g) `P1E02 - My second experiment`

3. Next, apply the experiment template by using `cmd + t` and navigating to the `experiment` template using either your mouse of the arrow keys followed by 'enter'.

	- The [[experiment|experiment template]] is relatively basic so please customize to your liking! Of note, there are a few features which ground the experiment file:

4. Next, lets add a specific tag to your experiment. Tags are the backbone of this obsidian vault as they are used to automatically sort and move notes to their respective folders independent of content. This automatic movement of notes is mediated by the [auto note mover](obsidian://show-plugin?id=auto-note-mover) community plugin and uses either `#tags` or [regular expressions](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.php) to 'scan' notes and move them to different folders within the vault.  
	- To you new experiment, add `project-1` in the tags property located at the top of the note.

5. The note should be automatically moved to the `03_projects -> 01_project-1 -> 01_experiments`.
