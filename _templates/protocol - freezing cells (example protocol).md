## Before Getting Started:


1. Prepare labels for cryo tube freezing vials and include;
	- Full name of cells
	- Passage #
	- Cell Concentration 
	- Final Volume in Tube 
	- Freezing Date
	- Initials

2. Prepare Complete DMEM Media (CM)

| Reagent                                 | Volume | Final Concentration |
| --------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) | 500 mL | N/A                 |
| Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)                | 50 mL  | 10%                 |
| Penicillin-Streptomycin (5,000 U/mL)    | 5 mL   | 1%                  |
| GlutaMAX                                | 5 mL   | 1%                  |

3. Prepare freezing media: Scale As Needed

| Reagent                  | Volume | Final Concentration |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------- |
| Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) | 10 mL  | 50%                 |
| Complete Media           | 8 mL   | 40%                 |
| Dimethyl sulfoxide       | 2 mL   | 10%                 |
| Final Volume             | 20 mL  |                     |
‼️ Cool freezing media to 4˚C before use. 

4. Bring Trypsin-EDTA to room temperature 

### ⏳Estimated Time: 
- ≥1 hour 

### ⚠️ Biosafety Information: 
This protocol involves handling mammalian cell cultures, requiring adherence to **Biosafety Level 1 or 2 (BSL-1/BSL-2)** containment, depending on the cell type and source. Proper **personal protective equipment (PPE)**—including gloves, a lab coat, and eye protection—must be worn at all times. Work should be conducted in a **certified biosafety cabinet (BSC)** when handling cells to minimize contamination and exposure. **Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)** is cytotoxic and should be handled with caution to prevent skin and eye contact. **Liquid nitrogen storage** poses risks of severe cold burns and asphyxiation; always use cryogenic gloves and face protection, and store in a well-ventilated area. Dispose of all biological and chemical waste according to institutional and regulatory guidelines.

## Procedure

> [!NOTE] 
>  - Cells should be resuspended at a final volume 1 mL at 5e6-1e7 cells per milliliter
>  - One T175 can be used for 4-6 tubes. 

1. Prepare freezing media, invert to mix components and chill at 4˚C until ready to use. 

2. Wash cells twice with PBS: 
	- Using a sterile aspirator pipet and vacuum trap, aspirate growth media from the cell flask and wash cells with PBS. Repeat and leave the second wash in until ready to 

3. Detach cells using trypsin for 1-20 minutes
	- The concentration of trypsin and time needed for full cell detachment will be cell line dependent. Use the optimal parameters for your cell line.
	  
4. Quench trypsin: 
	- When cells have detached add equal volume of complete media to flask
	- Using a sterile serological pipet, wash the inside of the flaks to ensure cells are complete detached and ensure no large clumps are visible. 

 5. Using a serological pipet, transfer Cells from flasks into 50ml tube

6. (Recommended )Using a cell counter or hemocytometer and trypan blue, quantify the cell concentration and viability of your cell suspension 
	- Follow the manufacture protocol for either cell counting method.

7.  Centrifuge cell suspension for 7 min at 500xg to pellet cells. 
    
8. Using an aspirating tip and vacuum trap, aspirate the supernatant taking care not to disturb the cell pellet. 
    
9.  Add freezing media to the desired final cell density and mix cells by pipette up and down to ensure a single cell suspension 
	- 5e6 - 1e7 cells/mL in 1mL is recommended for most cell lines
	   
10. Add 1 ml to each labeled tube. 
    
11. Place tubes in an isopropanol (Mr. Frosty)
	- Add 100% isopropanol to the fill line of the Mr. Frosty. 

12.  Transfer the Mr. Frosty containing all cells to a –80°C freezer
    
13.   After 18-24 hrs.  Move cell vials from -70C to liquid nitrogen for long term storage
