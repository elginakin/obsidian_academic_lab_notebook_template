# Outstanding Tasks 

Everyone has a different way they organize tasks. If you so choose to integrate all of a part of your task management into this lab notebook, I have setup a basic example of how that could look. 

Below is an example use case of the [tasks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) plugin to coalesce tasks delimited by a `- [ ] ` . Using a tasks code block, we can view all tasks in one place and query by varying attributes of an individual tasks. A full walkthrough of how to use this plugin can be found here: [Introduction - Tasks User Guide - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction)
