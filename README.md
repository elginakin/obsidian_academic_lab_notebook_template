# Introduction 

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome. This repository houses a scaffold digital laboratory notebook constructed in obsidian. Its intent is to supply academic users with an automated with a semi-automated and approach to designing/executing/recording experiments while simultaneously incorporating findings from the literature all in one centralized and local (on your native machine) place. 
# Motivation 

I am currently finishing up my PhD in Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins University. This notebook is a product of an insatiable need to over-structure my life while I navigate the world of academia. Moreover, I was growing tired of using multiple applications for tracking experiments and found myself constantly citing the summarizing the literature within my old lab notebooks. The nature of my dissertation work has resulted in many projects continually opening, closing and merging resulting in parallel execution of many different experiments.  

Another more serious motivator for this lab notebook is the acknowledgment that the biological sciences is often confounded with difficulties to reproduce reported experimental results.[^1] While many contributors to this problem are conceptual in nature, this notebook aims to remedy a practical one: lowering the time and effort needed to capture details of experimental design and results. In this new era of science, we as graduate students are producing more data than ever before. This, in part, falls in the wake of new technology which gives more bang for our buck in any given experiment and while there are many Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN) solutions out there, I found that none of them fully fit my specific needs.
