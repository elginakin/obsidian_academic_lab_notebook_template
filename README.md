# Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! This repository contains a scaffolded digital laboratory notebook built in Obsidian. Its purpose is to provide academic users with a semi-automated approach to designing, executing, and recording experiments while simultaneously integrating findings from the literatureâ€”all in one centralized, local (on your native machine) workspace.
# Motivation

I am currently completing my PhD in Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins University. This notebook is the result of my insatiable need to over-structure my life while navigating academia. I grew tired of using multiple applications to track experiments and constantly found myself citing and summarizing literature in my old lab notebooks. The nature of my dissertation work has led to many projects opening, closing, and merging, requiring the parallel execution of numerous experiments.

A more serious motivation for this lab notebook is the widespread challenge of reproducibility in the biological sciences.[^1] While many contributing factors are conceptual, this notebook aims to address a practical one: reducing the time and effort required to document experimental design and results. In this new era of science, graduate students are generating more data than ever before. This is largely due to advancements in technology that allow us to extract more information from each experiment. While many Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN) solutions exist, I found that none fully met my specific needs.[^2]


> [!IMPORTANT]
> This vault and the instructions herein were assembled in a MacOS environment thus paths within core and community Obsidian plugins may need manual curation to operate as expected.
